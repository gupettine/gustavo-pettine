                Hello, I'm Gustavo Pettine, a software engineer dedicated to creating
                innovative solutions through programming. In addition to my interest
                in the code world, I devote my time to constant study. Currently, I'm
                completing the final semester of my Computer Science degree at the
                Federal University CEFET/RJ, and I'm eager to apply and expand the
                skills acquired, actively contributing to the development of technological
                solutions that positively impact the world around me.
